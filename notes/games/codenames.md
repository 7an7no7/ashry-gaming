# أسماء الرموز (Codenames)

Moved from GEMINI.md on 30 Sep 2026. GEMINI.md keeps the rules that apply to every game and an index; this file keeps the detail, word for word.

## From GEMINI.md: Multiplayer rooms

**Codenames.** Only the key is secret. Everything else is in `shared`:

- `settings`: the host's options from the lobby. A turn clock (`CODENAMES_TIMERS`),
  spymasters rotating each game, and the room's own words, which go on the board
  first.
- `wins`: the evening's score.
- `marks`: who suspects which card. They are public, and cleared when that card
  turns or the turn ends.
- `log`: each clue, with the cards turned under it.

A clue can't be a word still on the board (compared through `normaliseClue`). A
clue of 0 or ∞ sets `guessesLeft` to -1: no limit. With a clock, `endsAt` covers
the clue and then the guessing, and `roomTimeout` passes the turn when it runs
out.

On a phone a tap marks the card and picks it. Revealing is a second, deliberate
press (`cnLocal.pending`), so a mis-tap never costs the turn. The sides, the
options and the score survive "play again" and a trip to the hub (`_teamsMemo`,
`_cnMemo`).

## History

The day-by-day log of the work on this game is in `notes/log.md` (search it for the game's name); a new entry goes there, and anything that changes how the game works goes in this file.
